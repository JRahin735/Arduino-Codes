# Arduino Codes Repository

Welcome to the **Arduino Codes** repository! This repository contains various Arduino projects and code snippets that demonstrate different functionalities, including sensor integration, display control, and system automation.

## Repository Overview
This repository includes code for multiple Arduino projects, categorized based on their functionality:
- **Sensor Integration**: Scripts that read data from various sensors such as ultrasonic, temperature, and humidity sensors.
- **Display & Output Control**: Code for LCD displays, LED lighting control, piezo speakers, and servo motors.
- **Communication Between Arduinos**: Implementations of wired communication between multiple Arduino boards.
- **Automation & Control Systems**: Projects focusing on smart systems, such as automated light control and smart plant management.

## Project Highlights
Some notable projects in this repository:
1. **Smart Plant Management System**
   - Uses multiple sensors (light, humidity, ultrasonic) to monitor plant health.
   - Communicates between two Arduino boards to control LED lights and an LCD display.

2. **Digital Pet for Mental Well-being**
   - Uses an LCD screen and sensors to simulate interactions with a digital pet.
   - Encourages user engagement and emotional well-being.

3. **LCD Name & Quote Display**
   - A simple program that prints a name and a custom quote on an LCD screen using `millis()` instead of `delay()`.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- **Arduino IDE**: Install [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) to compile and upload the code.
- **Hardware Components**: Some projects require additional hardware such as sensors, LCD screens, and servo motors.
